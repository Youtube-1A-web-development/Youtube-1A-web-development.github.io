# Youtube-1A_Pokedex
Team Introduction:
------------------
 Our team is Youtube 1A. We are from SMJK Heng Ee. Our team have three members, Howard Sii, Choo Jun Feng and Looi Zheng Jin. Horward Sii is the team leader.

Concept and Purpose: 
--------------------
Our pokedex is built to let knowpokemon newcomers  basic information of pokemons like pokemon names, type and number.

Project's Key Featuresüîë:
-------------------------
The feature that stands out most for our project would be the "load more" button". This is basically lazy loading to avoid the overload of the API server from fetching to many data at once.

Live Demo:

Design Choicesüé®:
-----------------
We feature a colorful design and pokeball background, inspired by the Pokemon franchise's visual style.

User Interfaceüì±:
------------------
Once loaded in, the user can see 10 pokemon datas surrounded with a red border. To see more, the user can press the "load more" button that adds 10 more pokemon to the page. As we did not implement scroll bars at this stage, user would nedd to use the browser scroller to navigate throught the page.

Interactive Elementsüëã:
------------------------
We did not add any interactibe element other than the "load more" buttonüò¨

HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptüë®üèª‚Äçüíª:
-----------------------------
 Provide an overview of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were utilized in your project. Highlight the role of each language in different aspects of your Pokedex.
 We used HTML to structure content and define the layout of elements. We also used CSS to style and visually enhance the appearance of the web application.We used Javascript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the Pok√©dex application.

Libraries and Frameworks:
-------------------------
 We did not use any third party libraries but we did use chatgpt to assist us.

Responsive Design:
------------------
The code we implemented in the CSS was vh and vw. This functions lets our pokedex container makes the most out of the possible view height and width. To limit the view on larger devices like a laptop, we limited its max width to 600 pixels.

Development Challenges: 
-----------------------
We faced a huge problem as we did not know how to write web code.

Problem-Solving: 
----------------
We seeked assistance from chatgbt. It wrote the basic code for us and we did some modifications. We included the prompts in another file.

Potential Additions:
--------------------
 We will add a search engine to make it easier for others to find the pokemon that they are looking for. We will also add more details to every pokemons.

Technical Learning: 
-------------------
We had used HTML, CSS and Javascript to do the web aplication. We also fetch Pok√©mon data from a public API, like the Pok√©API.

Personal Development: 
---------------------
Reflect on the personal growth and teamwork skills gained throughout this project.
