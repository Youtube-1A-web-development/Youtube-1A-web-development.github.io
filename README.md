Prompt: Can you please give me codes for a pokedex website using html
Answer : Sure, I can provide you with a simple example of a Pokédex website using HTML. Keep in mind that this example will be very basic and won't include any dynamic functionality or advanced styling. You can expand and improve upon it as needed.

In this example, we've created a simple Pokédex website with three Pokémon cards. Each card contains the name of the Pokémon, an image, and its type. The styling is very basic, so feel free to customize it to make it look better. Also, keep in mind that this example uses static data and images. If you want to create a more dynamic Pokédex that fetches data from an API, you'll need to use JavaScript and possibly additional technologies.
